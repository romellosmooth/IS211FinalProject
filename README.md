Project Option 2: Blog Application
Details
The purpose of this web application is to give a user the ability to run their own blog. A blog is just a
series of posts made by an author. Each post has a title, a published date, an author, and textual
(HTML) content. When first loading the application at the root URL, the user should be presented with a
list of available posts listed in reverse chronological order (newest posts first). The application should
allow a user to login via the ‘/login’ URL, which gives that user the ability to make changes to the blog.
After logging in, the user should be sent to the ‘/dashboard’ page, which presents the user with an
interface that:
1. Shows a list of their posts in a table. This list just shows the title of the post, with buttons
labeled ‘Edit’ and ‘Delete’. This edit button will take the user to a page that allows them to
update the post. The delete button will simply delete that post.
2. Allows the user to add a new post (This can be done either directly on the dashboard page
or on a new page).
